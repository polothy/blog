So, I decided to make a blog.

<!--more-->

# Who?

It's-a me, Mari...**cough** err.. It's me, Mark.

# What?

Blog... it's a blog.

# When?

Now.  I'm blogging now.

# Why?

Mostly just to jot down neat things that I discover while working
on various projects.  Posts will likely be very short in order to
keep things light and fun, _for me_, instead of a thesis project.

# How?

Requirements:

* **Dead simple.**  Since writing posts will be done in the evening,
  it has to be amazingly simple or it'll feel like work and I'll
  turn on the PS4 or Netflix.
* **Free.**  Or at least mostly free.  Not trying to be cheap or
  anything, but it is a blog that no one will read...
* **Static.**  No moving parts, just generated HTML from Markdown.
* **Something cool.** Would be nice to use something _neat_.

With the above in mind, I chose the following:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io): this is kind of no brainer.  Checks off
  all of my boxes: dead simple, static site generator and _neat_.
  Plus, since Hugo is such a nice project, it might actually be
  applicable to future projects.
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com): Simple and free hosting
  for the blog.  Might be fun to use something else later and get
  a proper domain name, but let's just get something going.
