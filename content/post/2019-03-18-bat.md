`bat` is the new `cat`.

<!--more-->

Recently started using [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) as a drop in
replacement for `cat`. What `bat` has going for it is that it can do some really
nice syntax highlighting. I often find myself cruising around on the CLI and I
need to take a look inside a file. I would usually use `less` for this or use
`vim` if I wanted some syntax highlighting. Now I can just use `bat` and it's
faster for my workflow. It even automatically pages with `less` so it is easy to
search and quit. Here is an example:

If that's too fancy for you, you can use `-p` to just get the syntax
highlighting. See the [project home page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) or
`man bat` for more details on what `bat` can do, like integration with `git`,
config file, etc.

You can of course pipe output to `bat`, but you need to tell it what the
language is so it can do the highlighting. EG:

```shell
kubectl get configmap istio -n istio-system -oyaml | bat -l yaml
```

Of course, I'm always big on making things look good. You can use `bat
--list-themes` to list available themes along with a short preview of each. You
can set one by adding the `BAT_THEME` environment variable to your profile:

```shell
# bat configs.
export BAT_THEME="OneHalfDark"
```

That's all. Really simple utility to help improve life on the CLI.
