A general purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

<!--more-->

It took a while for [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to click for me. A
lot of folks excitedly wrote about it and it certainly looked neat, but I was
initially finding it hard to see the true productivity value it could bring to
my CLI life. But, I decided to give it a try and I'm glad that I did.

## Setup

[Install](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation) is easy and there is a
`brew` option as well. At time of writing, there is a second step to run an
install.

From there, you are off onto customization:

* [Color schemes](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Color-schemes).
* Switch from `find` to [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd).
* Discover [related projects](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Related-projects).
* And down the [rabbit hole](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Examples).

## Default usage

Out of the box, `fzf` comes with a lot of neat functionality. My _absolute
favorite feature_ is the **history search**. You hit `CTR-r` and then you can fuzzy
find your entire CLI command history. This feature _alone_ is enough for me to
keep `fzf` forever! Countless times I have grabbed complex commands from my
history that I knew were there, if I could just find them. Now I can!

If you enabled the [completion
feature](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fuzzy-completion-for-bash-and-zsh), you
get some other nice goodies as well. For example, you can select a file by doing
`vim **<TAB>` and then fuzzy select one or more files to edit. This one isn't
always useful since some of my projects include a silly number of files. But, it
is certainly handy when it works out and saves you from having to `TAB` down a
directory structure to finally find the file. There are several other
completions as well, the one for `kill` is also very nice.

## Going beyond

There are many projects that integrate with `fzf`. Currently playing around with
[forgit](https://github.com/wfxr/forgit) which wraps some `git` commands with
`fzf`. I especially like the file selector commands it has for adding, checking
out or resetting files.

The [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) project also integrates with
`fzf`. It is especially useful when you alias the commands to something shorter
like:

```shell
alias kc='kubectx'
alias kn='kubens'
```

I'm currently exploring if I can work `fzf` into other parts of my `kubectl`
workflow, but haven't nailed it down yet.

## Conclusion

There is a lot to discover with `fzf` and it is easy to get overwhelmed by the
configuration or the fancy commands that you can construct with it. I suggest just
installing it and using the default functionality first. If it is your cup of
tea, then go nuts on extending it. I do think the right way to build off of
`fzf` is with shell functions or aliases so you can nail down the functionality
and make it really easy to invoke.
